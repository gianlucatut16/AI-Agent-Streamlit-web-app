# AI-Agent-Streamlit-web-app
For the exam in Text Mining the professors asked me to create an agent OpenAI, train it on two text files about division of assets after divorce and inheritance in Italy. I had to create a streamlit app to interact with the agent with a conversation. Obviously the agent before answering has to take into account the ongoing conversation too.
